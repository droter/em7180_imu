    # Define output variables from updated quaternion---these are Tait-Bryan
    # angles, commonly used in aircraft orientation.  In this coordinate
    # system, the positive z-axis is down toward Earth.  Yaw is the angle
    # between Sensor x-axis and Earth magnetic North (or true North if
    # corrected for local declination, looking down on the sensor positive
    # yaw is counterclockwise.  Pitch is angle between sensor x-axis and
    # Earth ground plane, toward the Earth is positive, up toward the sky is
    # negative.  Roll is angle between sensor y-axis and Earth ground plane,
    # y-axis up is positive roll.  These arise from the definition of the
    # homogeneous rotation matrix constructed from q.  Tait-Bryan
    # angles as well as Euler angles are non-commutative that is, the get
    # the correct orientation the rotations must be applied in the correct
    # order which for this configuration is yaw, pitch, and then roll.  For
    # more see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_between_q_and_Euler_angles
