### Calibration

https://github.com/gregtomasch/EM7180_SENtral_Calibration

### Wiring

    Connect the em7180 to your Raspberry Pi

    For the RPi SDA and SCL should have external pull-up 4.7kohm resistors (to 3.3V). 

        Hardware setup:
        EM7180 __________ RPi 3
        3V3 _____________ 1 (3.3V)
        SDA _____________ 3 (SDA)
        SCL _____________ 5 (SCL)
        GND _____________ 9 GND
        INT _____________ ???

### Installation

    cd ~/catkin_ws/src
    git clone -b master https://github.com/droter/em7180_imu/
    cd ~/catkin_ws
    catkin build

### Usage

    Python SMbus requires root access. It may therefore be required to run it as root:

        sudo su

    You could however consider adding the user to the I2C usergroup to avoid running the package as root.

        adduser $USER i2c

    To run the driver:

        roslaunch em7180_imu imu_driver.launch
        
    To run the visualization:

        roslaunch em7180_imu imu_viz.launch

            Yaw is positive when rotated counter clockwise.
            Pitch is positive when nose is down.
            Roll is positive when left side is up.
            
            Yaw is zero when pointing East
